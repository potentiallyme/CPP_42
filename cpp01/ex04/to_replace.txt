some years ago, as a joke, someone created a sentence using “that” multiple times in a row.
i can only remember the four “that” version. 
i am not sure that that “that” that you used, was done so correctly.
that joke wasn't that funny, that that could muster that much of a laugh out of that many people is the reason that i hate the word that.

so many people and so much laughing, so much so that if i so much as found myself so inclined to cry, i'd regret it so.
so instead, i spent so much more time trying oh so hard to laugh with the crowd, so i could be involved, so much more involved.

a big dog in a big city, by a big kennel by a big house, big owners, big toys, everything was big for this big dog.
yet big dreams don't always lead to big rewards, i'm big on that, big time.
bigger dreams can lead to bigger rewards, sure, but how big can big get?
